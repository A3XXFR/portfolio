#### Inspiration
The Palm Pavilion takes inspiration from the palm tree. The palm tree in general has been very important throughout history, specifically, in the UAE.

“For us, the date palm is, and always has been, truly the tree of life. We have grown up with this remarkable species and its many products and find it impossible to imagine life without it. When we admire a date palm, we are looking at the foundations of our civilization and the sustaining force for countless generations.” ~ Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan

The Palm Pavilion was designed to directly reflect the huge importance the Palm tree has played in the history of the UAE.

#### The Design
The Pavilion consists of four elements. The three palm inspired pillars, the ribbed side walls and roof, the glass curtain walls on the front and back and the round benches around the pavilion.

##### THE PILLARS
The pillars take their shape from the trunk of a palm tree. The organic swooping design starts at the bottom on the floor and blends seamlessly with the roof lines. In addition, the pillars are divided into ribs to imitate the look of wooden veneer.

##### THE WALLS AND ROOF
The design incorporates two types of wall. The first type is located on either side of the pavilion. These walls are a series of ribs and extend from the front to the back of the pavilion. The ribs are slanted and curve into the roof. Glass panels will be integrated into the ribs to isolate the interior from the exterior.
The second type of wall is used on the front and back of the pavilion. These curtain walls allow for wonderful views of the unique palm inspired pillars. They also allow visitors to look out into the beautiful landscaping of Manarat Al Saadiyat.
The roof continues the theme of using ribbed elements. The ribs of the pillars and side walls blend in with the rook to create a flowing building profile. The ribs on the roof represent the leaves of the palm tree. The leaves (the roof) sprout from the tree trunk (the pillars) and curve down towards the ground.
The ribbed walls and roof allow light to filter into the pavilion creating a pattern of light throughout the building. They may also allow for natural ventilation if they aren’t closed off by glass panels.
Each rib can be divided into multiple pieces and fabricated off site. The suggested material is steel or reinforced concrete. The fabricated pieces can then be transported and assembled onsite. 

##### FURNITURE
The round seating incorporated into this design are fitted around the pillars. They imitate vegetation that commonly grows around trees. The seating allows for intimate conversations between 2 people. They can also be used to seat larger groups of people when required from things like talks and presentations. The design of the seating can be replicated minus the pillar to seat more people when required.
