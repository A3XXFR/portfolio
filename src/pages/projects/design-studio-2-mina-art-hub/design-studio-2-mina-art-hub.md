#### Project Summary
Al Mina Art Hub was a studio project which placed a special focus on the concept and form of the building. 

The Hub was a cultural exhibition space designed to be a center for art in Abu Dhabi. The project was located right of the Dhow Harbor, in Al Mina, across the sea from what is now the Abu Dhabi Youth Hub.

#### Concept
The original design was inspired by the National Day Air Show that takes place on the Corniche in Abu Dhabi every year. The fluidity of the planes flying over each other was incorporated into the design. The design had only two wings at first. After a few iterations, later the design had four wings in order to accommodate all program requirements
