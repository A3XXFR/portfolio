#### Description
This master plan was created as a response to a prompt to create a neighborhood that achieves as many Estidama Pearl Points as possible. The site is in western Al Ain and is bordered by a small pond, Al Ain Wadi, and an existing residential compound.
#### Achieving Points
To achieve the points, the Estidama Manual by the Urban Planning Council was studied and, where possible, the requirements were applied to the master plan of the site. A total of 14 points were achieved.
