#### Concept and Brief
Al Bateen Library was the final Design Studio project. It is meant to be preparation for the graduation or capstone project. As such the project must include everything learned in past studios and courses to end with a sophisticated design that shows that the student is ready for graduation projects.

The site was located in the Al Bateen Area on Abu Dhabi Island. It is right next to the architectural landmark Al Bateen Mall which is known for its concrete shell.
By projects end a beautiful library inspired by Islamic architecture and the site context was produced.

The building has a total built area of 12,500m2. The library has a capacity for over 54,000 volumes on the public stacks and a further 110,000 volumes in the archives. In addition, its auditorium can seat more than 530 people.
