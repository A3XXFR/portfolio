#### The Development
Al Jazeera Youth Hub was a development designed to fill a major need of Abu Dhabi. It is comprised of two structures, a
 Youth Forum and a Youth Hostel.

#### The Forum
The Youth Forum was designed to give Abu Dhabiâ€™s Youth a place to come relax, work, play and collaborate. With a
 total area of 6849m<sup>2</sup> the youth forum houses many facilities that are required by the youth of today. Such
  facilities include areas for learning such as classroom and workshops. Areas for play, such as a gaming center and plenty of open space for sports activities are available. In addition, the forum has an auditorium, multi-purpose hall and exhibition space to show off the skills and talents of the youth. Finally, the youth hub is a center for collaboration, whether it be a young entrepreneur looking to start the next big thing or students looking to work on a group project, the library, meeting rooms and lounges make this is the place to collaborate.

#### The Hostel
The Youth Hostel was designed to allow groups of travelling students and their teachers to come to Abu Dhabi and stay affordably and comfortably. The hostel has a capacity of 56 people. Its facilities include a cafeteria, laundry room and lounges.

The Hostel was designed as an exercise in design that needs a quick turn around. The 'mini' project was designed in
 one week.
