#### Project Summary
Students from all over the United Arab Emirates were invite by the Louvre Abu Dhabi in the winter of 2018 to participate in a Pop Up Architecture event. 
 
Teams from Abu Dhabi University, The Canadian University of Dubai, UAE University and The American University of Sharjah participated.

#### The Rain of Light
In buildings, the phenomena of ‘The Rain of Light’ is when architectural elements are used to soften or diffuse direct sunlight. The elements used not only help insulate a space from the sun, but also create rays of light. The movement of the sun allows the light to dance with the shadows as they smoothly spread across the space.

#### Concept and Purpose - A Place for Children
The structure attempts to break free from the massive and serious scale of the Louvre Abu Dhabi to create a less intimidating and more playful environment for children to come and express their creativity. The welcoming environment for children was achieved by lowering the maximum height of the structure to 1.5 meters, the ideal height for children.

<sub>Farasat's contribution to the project included the design and compilation of assets for the presentation of the project proposal. He was also one of three speakers to present the project at the Louvre Abu Dhabi theatre to the museum staff and the other teams participating in the event.
