#### Program
This studio was divided into two projects, a group project and an individual project. The group phase involved planning the given site whereas the individual phase focused on a specific area of the site planned in the previous phase.

#### Design Framework and Planning
During team brainstorming sessions, we decided we would divide our site into several smaller gardens. Each garden represents a different kind of garden from cultures all around the world.
This reflects the acceptance of the United Arab Emirates of all sorts of different cultures from all over the world.
The gardens planned were:
1. The Mughal Garden
1. The Persian Garden
1. The Japanese Garden
1. The Renaissance Garden
1. The Greek Garden
1. The Chinese Garden
1. The UAE Garden

The gardens are separated by a canal that runs through the park. Visitors enter through the UAE garden and can make their way around by crossing bridges that connect the gardens.
Visitors can rent canoes from a station in the Persian garden and travel through the canals to the various gardens. Between the Greek, Chinese and Japanese gardens are a series of dancing fountains.
