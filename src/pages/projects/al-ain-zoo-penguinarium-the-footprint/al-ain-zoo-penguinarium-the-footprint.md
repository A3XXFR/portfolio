                      achieved by creating three dome shaped forms or
                      varying sizes. Each dome imitates one toe of the

                      before the entrance. These ribs create an obvious and
                      interesting entrance to the building. On one side of
                      the ribs is the external penguin exhibition area and on

#### Concept
The Footprint was inspired by, you guessed it, the
footprint of a penguin. From the inception of the idea
the goal was to make the footprint of the building
mimic the footprint of a penguin. The goal was
achieved by creating three dome shaped forms or
varying sizes. Each dome imitates one toe of the
penguin’s footprint. To complete the concept of a
footprint in plan, ribbed shading elements begin
before the entrance. These ribs create an obvious and
interesting entrance to the building. On one side of
the ribs is the external penguin exhibition area and on
the other is a beautiful view of Al-Ain’s mountains.
