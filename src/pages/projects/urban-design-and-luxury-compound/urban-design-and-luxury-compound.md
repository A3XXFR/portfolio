#### Program
This studio was divided into two projects, a group project and an individual project. The group phase involved planning the given site whereas the individual phase focused on a specific area of the site planned in the previous phase.

#### Design Framework
The master site is located on the coast of S'adiyaat Island in the Marina District facing downtown Abu Dhabi. The studio decided as a whole the function of each part of the master site. Then each group took one third of the site to plan. Our group chose the area of the site with the best access. It was decided that the site would include the following:
1. City Walk
1. Dancing Fountains
1. Grand Mosque
1. Central Park
1. Luxurious Compound
1. Private Plaza
1. Business Marina
1. Business Marina Plaza

#### Planning
Next we planned the site as a team. Streets, tunnels, access and the locations on plots for different functions were decided. Walkability was given high priority and steps were taken to minimize the interaction of pedestrians with traffic. To achieve this, traffic is routed under the central park which acts as a vessel for pedestrians to use to be able to get from one side of the site to the other with no interaction with traffic. The park connect the compound, city park, promenade and business marina. The business marina was planned to be a cluster of office towers and business hotels. This id ideal because the location of the site places in the center between Downtown Abu Dhabi, Yas Island, Khalifa City and Abu Dhabi International Airport. City Walk was planned to be in between the various mixed and residential areas in of the site. A grand mosque was placed in a central area for easy access. A canal cuts through the site dividing it into mainland and island. On the island, a luxurious compound was planned to take advantage of the amazing views and location. 

#### The Compound
The compound was separated from the main land to as privacy was given a high priority. Two bridges connect the island to the mainland. The compound features 3, 4 and 5 bedroom villas. Each villa gets amazing views to the marina and Abu Dhabi.
