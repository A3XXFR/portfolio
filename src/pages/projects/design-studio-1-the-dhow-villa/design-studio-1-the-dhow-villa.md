#### Concept and Inspiration
The villa was inspired by the dhow boat commonly used in the middle eastern region for fishing, pearl diving and much more. It is a part of the history of the region. The resemblance to the dhow is most clearly seen in elevations and sections.

#### Client Story
A small family of four. A husband, wife, son, and daughter. A very outdoor family. Love to go out to the park for a picnic or to the beach to have a swim. Both parents work. Father is a lawyer with his own a small practice. Mother is a surgeon who works late hours. Both children are young and in school.

###Features
#### East Facade
The entrance of the building and the front/east façade of the building is made up of interesting angles and lines. This has been done to make the entrance a distinguished part of the building.

#### Indoor Garden
Inside the landscaping continues and seamlessly integrates with the exterior landscaping. The indoor garden serves to add variation to the inside of the building as well as divide the usable area of the first floor into different zones/areas.

#### Landscaping
Walking to the front of the building reveals a beautifully crafted landscape. Complete with a pool, deck, and of course the buildings’ signature water canal.

#### The Water Canal
The water canal is a specially designed element of the project that seemingly brings the water of the sea around and into the building. The water not only surrounds but also enters the building.
